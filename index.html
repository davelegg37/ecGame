		<div>The main elements of the eo-boiler system, business and public are connected by a system or pipes and valves. The primary purpose of all pipes is to move either liquid of gas. The pipes in your eo-boiler system move money and economic things between the public and business. Economic things flow in the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) pipe while money flows in the GDI (Gross Domestic Income) pipe. Notice that, much like a steam system where water may be steam or water depending on where it is, in the ec-boiler system money and economic things take on different forms depending on where they are in the system. Money may take the form of a pay check, consumer spending, revenues, savings, etc. depending on where it is, Economic things may be consumer goods and services, inventories, employment etc. depending' on where it is. The GDP pipe and the GDI pipe are connected by a crossover pipe. The existence of this pipe equalizes pressure in both the GDP and GDI pipe which means that anything which happens in the GDP pipe will effect what happens in the GDI pipe and vice versa. If your income goes up,GDI, you will spend some of if causing consumption ,GDP, to increase. This crossover pipe also ties the whole system together which means that everything in the system is interconnected. Thus, something occurring in one part of the system will eventually effect all the other parts of the system. If you spend more, consumer spending increases, and eventually income will rise, maybe not yours but someones. Figure that one out using your diagram. The flow in the GDP and GDI pipes are in opposite directions. The money flows in one direction while the economic things flow in the other. The reason for this is simple. Money brings forth economic things. your money buys a TV set, the TV set flows to you, the consumer, and your money flows to the maker of the TV set. consumer industry. Just as the more you work the more you make etc. etc. The flow in both pipes is also circular which means that even though it goes through markets. industry and the public and can be side tracked into banks. government. and imports, it can eventually come back to where it started. Because this is a circular flow system, once the flow of money or economic things starts to increase or decrease they tend to increase or decrease by themslves. Look at your diagram and try to figure out why. ( the fancy explanation is a reinforcing feedback loop, you can think of it as a dog chasing his tail)

		<div>To be an economist you must be able to apply the theoretical world 
( the Eonomic Boiler System) to the real world and use that knowledge to do economic analysis.

You apply  the theoritcal model to the real world
 by identifying real world examples in your Economic Boiler System. There are three levels of identification Easy, Moderate and Hard. you get one point for each eazy identifition; two for moderate, and three for hard. You must have a score of 50 or higher in the identity category to qualify to be an econmist.

You will demonstrate  your economic analytical abilities  by successfully completing  six economic cause effect analysis.

After successfully completing your real world application and your economic analysis you will be a certified economist

		<div>Now that you have a basic understanding of the ec-boiler system it is time to introduce you to a few sophistications. 
Now lets take a more detailed look at the Business sector. Look at the blow up. Notice that the capital goods, producer resources industry and  the consumer industry are themselves connected by a series of pipes and the Capital goods market (valve). These pipes and valves function like the pipes and markets in the rest of your ec-bciler system with a few slight variations. 
First of all, unless you are a salesman for main frame computers or giant steam turbines, you are probably unfamiliar with this market or what is bought and sold there. 
Second. where as consumers buy most things with their own money and borrow a little the process is reversed for businessmen who purchase most of their capital goods with money borrowed from banks or gotten from their stock holders and seldom from their own pockets. 
The significance of this last difference is to cause the capital goods market to be very sensitive to interest rates. As interest rates rise investment declines. You may have noticed that when the prime interest rate increases the stock market usually has a bad day. </div>
		<div>Econmic Map
</div>
		<div>Now direct your attention to the big tank on the left side of the diagram entitled Public. Imagine this tank as the fuel tank for the system. This tank is the source of both labor and capital, the"fuels consumed by the boilers of business. This is a complicated fuel tank. The primary source of both labor and capital is population. The labor pool is derieved from the population as is savings which are an important source of business capital. The level of population is not static but is dependent on flows into and out of the tank. Flows into the population tank are controlled by both birth rates and immigration rates. Flows out of the tank are controlled by death rates and emigration rates 
Laborers come from the population but not everyone in the population is in the labor pool. Education, skill level, age even social mores determine what part of the population flow through into the labor pool. Labor for the labor market can only come from the labor pool, not the general population. Savings, a primary source of money for both business borrowing (capital) and government borrowing (budget deficits ) also comes from the population. The amount of money available for business capital depends on many things. The amount of money available for business capital equals public savings minus consumer borrowing and government borrowing. Thus the less money people save or the more they or government borrow, the less capital there is available for business to use for investment. Now when Johnny asks the question where did the family car come from, or his clothes or even the evening meal, we have an answer. They were created in the boilers of business which uses for fuel the labor and capital it draws from the fuel tank of population.

		<div>The Economic Boiler System
A simple way to understand the economic system through metaphor

</div>
		<div>                                              The Economic Boiler System 
For most people trying to understand the economic system and comprehend economic explanations is like listening to an insurance salesman explain life insurance policies. In both cases the listener usually turns off and tunes out because he lacks an overall understanding of what is being explained .This does not have to be the case in economics. You can achieve economic understanding because simple models are available which will allow you to categorize, relate and integrate economic facts. Even though these models have been around a long time they have been denied to the general public because they are complex rather then simple and rely on mathematics and an esoteric vocabulary for their explanation. To remedy this situation we will present to you a model of an economic system that you can easily understand and use. We will be using an analogy between an economic system and a boiler system because an economic system may intimidate us but most of us already have an understanding of a simple boiler system with its pipes, valves, tanks and boilers. Because pictures speak louder then words our explanation of the ec-boiler system will center around a diagram of that system. It is important that you constantly refer to the diagram as you read this The ec-boiler system consists of a fuel tank [the public), (1) and a boiler [ business], (2) which are connected by a system of pipes(3} and automatic valves, [markets](4). There are also control reservoirs[ the Govt and the Fed], (5},(6), which are connected to the system through pipes with manually controlled faucets(7) (8). Fuel is delivered from the Public (fuel tank) to the Business(boiler) through pipes which are regulated by markets the (automatic valves). In the business boiler the fuel. labor and capital, (money,)(9}(10) are converted into economic goods and services which are in turn delivered to the public and other business through more pipes and markets where they are consumed(11 )(12). Now that you have a general idea of the ec-boiler system and how it works it is time to get specific and see how each of the individual parts of the system function.  You can use map of the system to  understand how the individual parts work. Just click on the Economic map below and learn about the parts which interest you by clicking the  links ( in red) on the map. 
There is also a  basic animation of the model designed to give a basic feeling for how your system works. You can reac it from any place by clicking on the The Economic Animation Button. This isn’t a book it is a manual so use it accordingly. 
Once you grasp the basic schematic you should be able to use it to understand you’re economic system.Once  you have a basic understanding of the ec-boiler systemyou can try to become a certified  economist.

		<div>Apply your model
</div>
		<div>Now that you are familiar with a theoretical model of the economic system, (the economic boiler system) it is time to apply it to the real world.
First you have to be able to relate the real world to your model by identifying where things located in the real world are located within the model. To help you do this you will be given lists of actual real world things and asked to locate them in your model. There are four identifying exercises that get progressively harder just choose what you want to identify, go to the model and click of where you think it is located.
You will get one point for each correct easy identification, two points for moderate and three for hard. When you have a total 50 or better Ident points you will become a certified economist and eligble to try and become an economic anaylisit.

The second way is to use your model to make economic predictions ie. economic cause and effect. You will be given an economic event and  then by studying your economic boiler asked to select the most likely outcome. The next harder level in this series of exercises is to determine the order in which they occur.
Once you have completed these exercises you should have a better understanding of the complexity of the real world economic system and how it works.

		<div>Begin Analysis
</div>
		<div>The theoretical model of the  economic system (economic boiler ) is a dynamic system. All it’s parts interact with each other in a logical ordered way. Thus when something happens to one part all the other parts will usually be effected, some in the short term and some in the long term as the immediate cause works its way through the system. Thus in the long run all effects become causes. Using your model to understand and predict changes to the economy from economic events is called economic analysis.
Now that you understand your economic system and can relate the model to the real world it is time to use it to perform real world economic analysis to predict and understand the economic outcomes of real economic events.
You will start by predicting the most probable  and immediate  result  of real world economic trigger events and finally predict long term results. In performing this economic cause effect analysis you should refer to the dynamic economic model so you are not just guessing but applying logical cause effect thinking.

		<div>The Automatic Regulating System
      It is now time to understand the role of markets in our system. Most steam systems have self regulating valves, or thermostats. The function of these valves is to maintain a certain equilibrium in the system by automatically adjusting to the whole system to meet changing comditions. When things get too hot the valves shut down, when things get too cold they open up automatically. The ec-boiler system has many such valves. Economists call them markets. 
 
There are four major markets. Consumer markets are the ones you are most familiar with, such as Walmart, shopping malls, beauty parlors etc .. You don't usually think of labor want ads, employment offices, and help wanted signs as markets but they are all labor markets. Places where borrowing or saving takes place such as banks, credit unions, Wells Fargo etc. are all money markets. A salesman traveling from business to business selling machines or equipment is a capital market. 
Now that you know where the markets are located in the real world and your ec-boiler system it is time to see how they work. Since valves and markets are dynamic by nature we will use a special set of diagrams to help you understand how they work. Since the primary function of all the market valves in your ec-boiler system is to regulate the flow of economic things and money they are all connected in some way to the pipes in the system. Both money and economic things flow from the pipes into the market-valves. Study the parts of the valve. It consists of a market place, the valve housing, the supply and demand curves, the moving parts of the market valve and the equilibrium price, the device which determines the actual volume of money and economic things flowing into and out of the market. It is the function of the market valve to continually adjust the flow in all the pipes to accommodate changes in the flows of anyone  of the pipes. 
Consider the Market (consumer or labor) Animation


      An increased flow of money into the market caused by an increase in consumer spending, people want more smart phones, will push the demand curve to the right. If the supply can't or doesn't change the equilibrium price will  rise which in turn results in an increase of flow in the revenue pipe and both the  pipes going into and out of the consumer market. 

      
If smart phone manufacturers respond to this increased revenue flow by building more  smart phones, the flow of  smart phones to the consumer market will move to the right and the equilibrium price will fall. 

    Again the flow in the other pipes will adjust. More smart phones  will be consumed and more revenues will flow to the smart phone makers, i.e. consumer industry. 
       See if you can describe how the market-valve adjusted the ec-bolier system as consumers stopped buying TV's. 

All markets work this way. As the demand for labor or money rises, wages, and interest rates rise and the markets automatically adjust the flows the other pipes to meet the new demand or supply. You must keep in mind that in the real world there are millions and millions of market valves a" quietly working to adjust the economy to changing conditions. 



</div>
		<div> Fed and Banks Although both the FED and the GOVT try to control the economy through increasing money in the GDI as the diagram indicates they use very different mechanisms to accomplish this. The FED must operate indirectly through money markets to accomplish its control. By controlling the money supply The FED can control the amount of money banks have available to loan. By increasing the supply of money in the money markets the interest rate should fall and people will borrow more and save less thus increasing the amount of money in the system. This, however, is very indirect. Even though interest rates fall people may still not wish to borrow. One must also remember that there are other factors which effect the supply of money. The result of this indirect control has been described by some economists as like string, it is easy to pull, suck money out of the system, but its not so easy to push, pump money into the system. Now consider the money market. The equilibrium price in this market, the interest rate, like other markets is determined by the interaction of supply and demand. The supply and demand curves in this market, however, are subject to forces that can be controlled. It is obvious from the diagram and the previous discussion that the FED can increase or decrease the supply of money at will and thus effect interest rates. What is not so obvious is that the actions of the government will also effect interest rates. If the government spends more then it takes in,i.e. runs a deficit, it must, just like you or I, borrow the money. The big difference is that you and I are small borrowers and we don't have unlimited credit thus, individually, we can't borrow all that much, but the government is big and has unlimited credit so it can borrow much more. When you or I borrow the interest rate isn't effected but when the government borrows it is. One should keep in mind, however, that when we as consumers act together we too can drive up interest rates. This preoccupation with interest rates is important because as a glance at your diagram will show raising or lowering the interest rate will determine increases of money in the GDI pipe and thus effect the whole system. 
</div>
		<div>The Government Budget 

The GOVT, by using its budget, has a much more direct effect then the FED. By closing the tax faucet, cutting taxes, or opening the spending faucet, increasing government spending, it can put money directly into consumers pockets. They don't have to go into a bank and borrow it. By the same  token they can reverse the process and take it back out of that very same pocket. 
            We like to assume that who ever controls these faucets is competent enough to read the economic gauges correctly and then manipulate fiscal policy (the govt budget) and monetary policy (the FED) in the appropriate way to avoid either inflation or recession. If GDP is falling should the government open or close the tax faucet? If you have full employment and consumer spending is rising should the FED increase or decrease the money supply? See. Its really very simply to manage your ec-boiler system. The question then arises as to why over the years we have had so much trouble doing so. To begin with the main controls of the FED and the GOVT are controlled by different operators. The Federal Reserve board and its chairman control the FED while the Government budget is determined by both the president and the congress. The result is an economy that often resembles a car with three people in the driver's seat. One has his foot on the brake and the other two have their feet strapped to the gas pedal. The ride if not catastrophic would at best be uneven. When one considers that congress and the president don't get along much of the time and no one can fire the FED chairman its not hard to understand why the government will often be pumping money into the system while at the same time the FED will be sucking it out. 


The GOVT by using its budget has a much more direct effect then the
FED. By closing the tax faucet, cutting taxes, or the spending faucet,
